CS-255: Systems Analysis and Design Portfolio Submission
Prepared by:** Tariq Mack  
Course:** CS-255 â€“ Systems Analysis and Design  
Date: June 2025  

 Course Reflection

CS-255 has easily been the most demanding and eye-opening course Iâ€™ve completed during my time as a Computer Science major. While Iâ€™ve written code in many other classes, this was the first time I truly had to step into the role of a systems analyst and look at the bigger picture. This course taught me that successful software development isnâ€™t just about writing clean code â€” itâ€™s about understanding the people who use it, anticipating their needs, and designing with purpose.

The amount of detail that goes into planning a fully functional system was something I underestimated going in. From identifying all possible user roles, writing thorough requirement documents, and planning data flow to creating use case diagrams and wireframes, I was exposed to the kind of real-world thinking required in professional software development environments. Itâ€™s one thing to code a login screen â€” itâ€™s another thing entirely to think through the requirements, constraints, edge cases, and long-term maintenance involved in building an enterprise-level application like DriverPass.

I found myself spending more time analyzing than coding â€” and that was the point. I learned to break down systems into modular, manageable components. I learned how to ask the right questions to identify stakeholder needs. I learned the value of good documentation and the risk of skipping over planning. These are lessons Iâ€™ll carry into every future development project.

This course didnâ€™t just challenge me â€” it reshaped the way I think about problem solving. It taught me that every feature I design has implications across performance, usability, security, and scalability. I walked away not only more confident in my technical skills, but also more prepared to communicate ideas, work on a team, and create solutions that are truly user-focused.

 Project Artifacts

This repository includes two major deliverables from CS-255 that highlight my journey through the software development lifecycle:

Business Requirements Document (Project One): `DriverPass_Business_Requirement-TariqMack (2).docx`  
-System Design Document (Project Two): `DriverPass_System.pdf`

Together, these documents represent the foundation of good system architecture: understanding the clientâ€™s needs, translating them into specific technical requirements, and modeling out how a real system should work to meet those goals. These artifacts reflect the entire system analysis and design lifecycle, from problem discovery to technical architecture planning.

## ðŸ’¬ Reflective Summary

### What was the DriverPass project and who was the client?

The DriverPass project simulated a real-world software development scenario. Our client, DriverPass, wanted a robust online learning platform to help students prepare for their DMV driving exams. The system needed to offer realistic practice exams, allow students to schedule on-the-road training sessions, and provide instructors and managers with tools for monitoring progress and managing schedules. It was an end-to-end platform involving multiple user types and workflows â€” a perfect use case to apply what we learned about systems analysis.

What made this project unique was the level of detail required to design for three separate user roles (students, instructors, and managers) while still ensuring a seamless experience across the system. This wasnâ€™t just about meeting functional requirements â€” it was about building something scalable, secure, and responsive enough for real-world deployment.

---

 What did you do particularly well?

One of my biggest strengths during this project was my ability to visualize the system from multiple perspectives. I paid close attention to how users would actually interact with the platform, and I mapped those interactions into clear, intuitive use case and activity diagrams. These helped guide the entire structure of the system and ensured no user behavior was overlooked.

I also focused on writing detailed, well-organized documentation. I worked hard to make the business requirements document not only technically accurate, but easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders. My writing style improved through this course, and I now understand how much value clear documentation brings to a project.

 If you could choose one part of your work to revise, what would you pick and how would you improve it?

If I had more time, I would have invested in expanding the user interface section of the system design. While I focused heavily on backend structure and logic, visual mockups or wireframes would have given a more complete picture of how the system would feel and function from the userâ€™s point of view.

In future projects, I plan to incorporate UI/UX tools like Figma or Adobe XD earlier in the process. These tools not only help with visualizing the design, but also allow for quicker feedback from users and stakeholders who may not be able to interpret technical diagrams as easily. Enhancing the front-end planning would make my system designs more well-rounded and accessible.

---

 How did you interpret user needs and implement them into your design? Why is this important?

I approached the design by first mapping out user roles and understanding their unique goals and pain points. Students needed mobile access and immediate feedback, instructors needed a clear way to track availability and student performance, and managers needed access to system-wide reports and user control panels.

These priorities shaped the core features of the system â€” everything from appointment scheduling logic to progress tracking and role-based access controls. Designing from the userâ€™s perspective helped me ensure that the system wasnâ€™t just functional, but also practical and intuitive. When users feel that a system understands their needs, it leads to better engagement, fewer errors, and greater overall success.

How do you approach software design? What techniques would you use in the future?

My approach to software design has become more layered and thoughtful through this course. I start with problem discovery, then move to user analysis, then to defining system boundaries and features. From there, I model the workflows, define the data structure, and map everything into a technical design document. Iâ€™m no longer rushing to code â€” Iâ€™m planning to design and designing to build.

In the future, I will rely heavily on Angela Zhangâ€™s approach to design documentation. Her emphasis on clarity, reviewability, testability, and adaptability resonates with the kind of developer I want to become. Iâ€™ll also use Agile techniques to incorporate earlier stakeholder feedback, making sure the system is validated at every step before it goes into development. Strong documentation and collaborative review are no longer just ideas to me â€” theyâ€™re essential practices I plan to carry forward.
